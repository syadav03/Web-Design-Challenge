# Web-Design-Challenge

For this homework assignment we created our own website using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap4. 

We'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.
In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

There will be a landing page, comparison page,data and vizualization page. This should all be interactive as well to change once an image is clicked. The link below shows you how it should work.
